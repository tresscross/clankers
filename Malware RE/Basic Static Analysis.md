Running `file` on the machine will attempt to show you the file type based on the information within the binary.
- It will also show if the file is **stripped**, meaning it has had it's symbol table and debugging information removed
	- this is often done to reduce the size of the binary and to make reverse-engineering harder
	- you can often use *gdb* or `objdump` to analyze stripped binaries
Can use [bintropy](https://github.com/packing-box/bintropy) to determine if bin is packed, can generate plots as well

#### FLOSS
- good string checker
`floss -n 7 <filename>`

#### Capa
- check for capabilities within the binary
`capa.exe <filename> -vv`

#### PE Studio
- one stop shop for tons of info. headers, sections, imports, strings, etc
