Beginning, you will want to make sure you create a pre-detonation snapshot of the machine to revert back to. Double check that the machine is isolated. To begin with basic dynamic analysis, we are going go go through the following:
### ProcMon
We will use ProcMon to observe executable actions. We can filter by the launched executable's name in the 'Process Name' field, and this will help us track what is going on.
### Wireshark
We can use Wireshark on both the FlareVM and the Remnux host to observe what network traffic is occurring. 
### Process Explorer
We can use Process Explorer to show detailed information about the currently running processes, including handles and DLLs.
### Autoruns
Shows things configured in autorun registry or boot, helps identify persistence mechanisms.
### TCPView
Displays a list of all currently open network connections and their associated processes.
### Regshot
You can use Regshot to take a predeto and postdeto snapshot of the system registry, regshot will compare the two and give you what was changed. You can also use it to see the same for folders with the `Scan dir` option box and inputting a path to monitor.
### strace
will run through a binary and show system calls and processes created

# Debugging with x64dbg

1. **F9** - Run: Continues execution until the next breakpoint.
	1. execution beings at the entry point
2. **F7** - Step Into: Executes the next instruction and enters into functions.
3. **F8** - Step Over: Executes the next instruction but skips over functions.
4. **Ctrl+F9** - Run to Selection: Runs the program until it reaches the line where the cursor is placed.
5. **Ctrl+G** - Go to Address: Jumps to a specific memory address.
6. **Ctrl+B** - Toggle Breakpoint: Sets or removes a breakpoint at the current line.
7. **Ctrl+E** - Evaluate Expression: Opens a dialog to evaluate expressions or modify registers/memory.
8. **Ctrl+R** - Run until Return: Continues execution until the current function returns.
9. **Ctrl+F2** - Restart: Restarts the debugging session.
10. **Alt+F9** - Show Breakpoints: Opens the breakpoints window to manage them.

## Debugging Entry Point

When loading into the debugger (dbg), you will be brought to the entry point. Typically, after the entry point, environments are created, such as the runtime environment, any wrappers for Windows function calls, etc. 

For example, a binary compiled with Nim can often use a module with similar naming to `NimMainModule`, whereas other binaries might just use `Main`.

## Analysis Checklist

At this point, we should have several items from our basic dynamic and full static analysis of the binary:

- General idea of what the binary does and what it interacts with.
- Notable Windows API calls.
- Some artifacts to build from, e.g., script or process names, file locations accessed, etc.
- Network calls made, including IPs or domain names.
- Memory locations of specific strings to create breakpoints at for dynamic analysis.

## Things to Note

- Creating breakpoints on memory access requires you to create them as hardware access.
- It's useful to find strings in the hexdump and create hardware access breakpoints.
- Use X-ref to see where stored `dword` or `data.XXXXX` values are assigned (press `x`).
- If the binary is packed, you will need to step through the unpacking routine to reach the original code. Advanced static analysis will not show the entire picture.
- Be careful of anti-debugging techniques, such as `IsDebuggerPresent` or `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent` calls.
    - Patch or bypass these checks to continue analysis.
- Always try to create breakpoints at critical API calls such as `CreateProcess`, `WriteFile`, `InternetConnection`, etc.
